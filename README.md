This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In total, there will be four parts to this project:

    Creating Static Components
    Passing Information to Components
    Setting the State of Ravenous Components
    Interacting with the Yelp API

Today, you will start by building the first part of Ravenous: Creating Static Components.

Here’s a quick overview of how Ravenous should function:

    As a user, I should be able to search for restaurants
    As a user, I should be able to view a list of restaurants returned by the Yelp API
    As a user, I should be able to sort through restaurants using a filter

The four projects will test your knowledge of JavaScript and React, all with the goal of building a Yelp-like clone. If you want to get a feel for what Ravenous can be, visit the Yelp website and search for restuarants in your area.

Finally, a few notes before getting started:

    In each project, you’ll be presented with the intended, final outcome (of that project) in the Codecademy browser component.
    You should expect to spend more than 1 day on this specific project. It’s the base of the entire app, and it will likely take a few days to complete this project. It’s OK if it is not all finished in one day.
    If you don’t understand how to implement a certain part of the project, we’ll provide guidance as needed. However, you should expect to search Codecademy for the exercises that will provide you with the relevant information.
    You should expect to complete all four Ravenous projects on your personal computer using your preferred tools (terminal, text editors, etc.).
